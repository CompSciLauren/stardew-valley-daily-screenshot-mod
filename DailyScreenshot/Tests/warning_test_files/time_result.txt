[Daily Screenshot] Swapping StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099"
[Daily Screenshot] StartTime is now "1140" amd EmdTime is now "1300" for rule "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099"
[Daily Screenshot] Setting limits on StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time No Overlap Directory"
[Daily Screenshot] Swapping StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time No Overlap Directory"
