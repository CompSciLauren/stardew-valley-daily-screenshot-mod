Times can be ignored.
Left hand side and right hand side should never both contain a "No Overlap" rule

Example:

Setting limits on StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099"
Swapping StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099"
StartTime is now "1140" amd EmdTime is now "1300" for rule "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099"
Setting limits on StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time No Overlap Directory"
Swapping StartTime and EndTime for rule "Time No Overlap Directory"
StartTime is now "1140" amd EmdTime is now "1300" for rule "Time No Overlap Directory"
Rules "Time No Overlap Morning" and "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099" can over write one another.
Rules "Location No Overlap Afternoon" and "Time Overlap Fixup 1300 to 1099" can over write one another.
