# Daily Screenshot v1.0.2

> A Stardew Valley mod that automatically takes a screenshot of your entire farm at the start of each day.

## Install

1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
3. Download this mod and unzip it into Stardew Valley/Mods.
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## How to use

The screenshot will be taken automatically once every in-game day, after you've first left your house. Screenshots are added to your StardewValley/Screenshots folder.

The StardewValley/Screenshots folder can be located by going to the in-game menu and scrolling to the very bottom of the Options tab.

Each screenshot is named with "year-season-day.png" numerical format. So on Year 1, Spring, Day 3, the screenshot would be named "01-01-03.png".

## Compatibility

- Works with Stardew Valley 1.4 or later on Linux/Mac/Windows.
- Works in both singleplayer and multiplayer.
- No known mod conflicts.

## Known Issues

- No configuration options are currently available in this mod. Configurations will be added in the next update (v1.1.0). This will include, among other things, configurations for weather (e.g. choosing to allow rainy weather to appear in screenshots, or disabling all weather besides "clear" weather).
