# Daily Screenshot - 1.0.1

> A Stardew Valley mod that automatically takes a screenshot of your entire farm at the start of each day.

## Install

1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. [Download the latest version of the Map Image Export mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1073?tab=description) and unzip it into Stardew Valley/Mods.
3. Download this mod and unzip it into Stardew Valley/Mods.
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## How to use

The screenshot will be taken automatically. Screenshots will be added in the following location on your computer: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\MapExport\Screenshots

Each screenshot is named with "year-season-day.png" numerical format. So on Year 1, Spring, Day 3, the screenshot would be named "01-01-03.png".

## Compatibility

- Works with Stardew Valley 1.4 or later on Linux/Mac/Windows.
- Works in both singleplayer and multiplayer.
- No known mod conflicts.

## Known Issues

- Screenshots currently show all days as having "clear" weather (even if it is raining, snowing, etc). The only exception is that on days that do not actually have clear weather, part of the actual weather can be seen in the upper-left hand corner of the screenshot.
- No configuration options are currently available in this mod. Configurations will be added in the next major update (v1.1.0). This will include, among other things, configurations for weather (e.g. choosing to allow rainy weather to appear in screenshots, or disabling all weather besides "clear" weather).
