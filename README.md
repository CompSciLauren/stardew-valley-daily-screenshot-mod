# Daily Screenshot v1.0.4

> A Stardew Valley mod that automatically takes a screenshot of your entire farm at the start of each day.

Releases can be found at the following websites:

- [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4779)
- [Chucklefish](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/daily-screenshot.5907/)
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/stardewvalley/mods/daily-screenshot)
- [ModDrop](https://www.moddrop.com/stardew-valley/mods/677025-daily-screenshot)

## Features

- A screenshot is automatically taken of your entire farm every day as soon as you leave your house.
- Stores screenshots in the StardewValley/Screenshots folder, with each save file getting its own "FarmName-Screenshots" folder, so you can easily access the screenshots in-game under the "Options" tab in the menu and screenshots from multiple save files will not get mixed up. The file path to the screenshots folder is C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\StardewValley\Screenshots
- Makes it super easy to gather screenshots to create a GIF that shows how your farm changes over time! There are many GIF makers that can be found online, such as [ezgif GIF maker](https://ezgif.com/maker).
- Keeps the screenshots in the correct order to make creating the GIF easier. This is achieved by naming each screenshot with a "year-season-day.png" numerical format. For example, on Year 1, Spring, Day 3, the screenshot would be named "01-01-03.png". 
- Custom configuration options coming near the end of December 2019!
